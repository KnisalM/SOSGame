At this time, buttons are non functional
Goal: 
--Implement a grid of buttons that can be selected by both player/player or player/computer
Requirements: 
--Buttons must lock in place once selected unless implementing a stealing system
--Must always differentiate between which click is coming from which player or the computer
Questions: 
--How to implement visual lines in the grid manager to create board effect while having the 
    visual of the lines of the game board on screen at the same time"""

--This allows for them to be selected/deselected, otherwise they are perpetually on

Goal: 
--Tie the checkbox into one of the intended functions of the game
    Ideally, the "show scoreboard" function which will show the 3 highest scores
    Recorded in that Session
Requirement: 
--Tie the checkbox, most likely just one, to a command that will show
--A top 3 scores for that session scoreboard
    The scoreboard will need to be maintained as the session goes on, and must be stored even when
    The checkbox is not currently selected to display it
--Scoreboard data storing will also need to be wiped at end of each session
Note:

"""So far using a canvas is the only way to create lines that I have found using Tkinter

--Finding a way to place buttons in the canvas not the grid manager
    OR
--Finding a way to create lines as elements and place them in the grid manager"""

"""Notes for Next Assignment/Thoughts going Forward
Potential Features: 
--2 player game mode and a Comp Game Mode (needs minimum computer to play)
--3 Score Scoreboard
--NEED to figure out how to place buttons in the canvas, or place lines in the grid manager
