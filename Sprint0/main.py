--Buttons must lock in place once selected unless implementing a stealing system
--Must always differentiate between which click is coming from which player or the computer
Questions: 
--How to implement visual lines in the grid manager to create board effect while having the 
    visual of the lines of the game board on screen at the same time"""

--A top 3 scores for that session scoreboard
    The scoreboard will need to be maintained as the session goes on, and must be stored even when
    The checkbox is not currently selected to display it
--Scoreboard data storing will also need to be wiped at end of each session

Potential Features: 
--2 player game mode and a Comp Game Mode (needs minimum computer to play)
--3 Score Scoreboard
